This is a repo for storing my labworks on Coursera, all secured with passwords.

<b>Coursera has an honor code, requesting that you should never make any content of your homework publicly available. So I've locked them up in archives.</b>

It's just for backup, not sharing.

For those who might be interested in starting their own journey in MOOC platforms like Coursera, I have written a memo/guide here.

<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35366209">Coursera Learning Notes</a> by Zhu Li on 2018.4.6.

<b>All archives in this repo are locked, please don't bother cracking, there's nothing valuable inside after all, just a pile of my old homework.</b>

If you think you've found something useful here, feel free to leave a star. <b>I'll be glad to know if my action is making this world better, by raising a helping hand.</b>

## Finished Courses

### Introduction to Blockchain Technologies

<li>Organization: <a href="https://www.insead.edu/">INSEAD</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-blockchain-technologies/">Introduction to Blockchain Technologies | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: February 5, 2022
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: Blockchain
<li>Review: This is the first course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/blockchain-revolution-enterprise">Blockchain Revolution Specialization</a>. It's been a year and half since I last visited MOOC. This is simply a conceptual introduction on blockchain. Relax and enjoy.

<li>Organization: <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data/">Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: August 4, 2020
<li>Grade: 95.1/100
<li>Topic: Java
<li>Review: This is the second course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming">Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization</a>. Still it's mostly about problem-solving, so I finished it in Python anyway. This time the challenge is a bit harder, as you're gonna have to do some DFS and pruning when trying to break the Vigenère cipher.
</ul>

### Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

<ul>
<li>Organization: <a href="https://duke.edu/">Duke University</a>
<li>URL: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming/">Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software | Coursera</a>
<li>Time: July 13, 2020
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: Java
<li>Review: This is the first course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming">Object Oriented Programming in Java Specialization</a>. To be honest I like the way it's taught and don't care much about the Duke Java library and the prehistoric BlueJ IDE (seriously?) they provided. <b>Because I did it in Python with minimal efforts.</b> It's totally about problem-solving, which renders language irrelevant. I learned nothing from the course, so it's considered sort of leisure.

<li>Topic: devops, kubernetes
<li>Review: This is the last course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-microservices">IBM Microservices Specialization</a>. Totally not worth the price.
</ul>

### IBM Cloud: Deploying Microservices with Kubernetes

<li>Review: This is the third course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-microservices">IBM Microservices Specialization</a>. The quality of this course is fair. I'd say it's a friendly tutorial for k8s concepts, worth about two days of study.
</ul>

<li>Topic: devops, microservice
<li>Review: This is the second course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-microservices">IBM Microservices Specialization</a>. I'm <b>even less impressed</b> with this one. Some course contents are directly copied from course 1. Is that responsible for students who paid? Besides, it's not difficult to see that the Microclimate product is out of maintenance, as their CICD pipeline docker image doesn't even build. <b>IBM was a great company</b>. Their ideas still are, but their blades already rusty.

<li>Topic: linear algebra, vector calculus
<li>Review: This is the <b>last course</b> of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning/">Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization</a>. I'd say the code in the notebook wasn't quite well-written. Some of them has to be reorganized so as to run efficiently.

<li>Time: April 26, 2019
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: mathematics
<li>Review: This is a rather interesting math course. It's very inspiring and not too tough. Try it if you're still undergraduate-level. If you're already getting a Master or Doctor's degree, it's gonna be too easy for you, thus spoiling the fun.
</ul>

### Machine Learning with Python

<li>Time: March 22, 2019
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: python, sql
<li>Review: It's easy, but no longer a no-brainer course. At least it takes you some time to design the sql query. <b>One thing especially terrible about this course is the DB2 Console, just lame.</b> The resource quota allocated for you was just too thin to make it work normally. Apart from this, I would say this course is still well-organized, if only we could do it with MySQL and Jupyter Notebook. It's IBM course after all, what else can I say? <b>I expect better QoS from you, IBM.</b>
</ul>

<li>Time: February 15, 2019
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: time series analysis, stochastic process
<li>Review: I thought this course was easy, but it turned out to be more mathy than I expected. The things taught here are rather traditional, but can be good training for a data scientist. Neural networks are expressive, but not so intepretable. Better learn some maths to keep your brain from getting so rusty, that you can only rely on superstition of RNG and SGD.<b>It's the way of thinking that's worth the time and efforts.</b> I have a <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/47810399">memo</a> here.

<li>Time: September 15, 2018
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: psychology, philosophy, sociology
<li>Review: This isn't a course that teaches you anything practical in terms of job-seeking or money-making. It's about more profound questions of human society and existence. If elite universities like Harvard and Yale are deemed as elites, this is the type of education that makes them qualified.

<li>Time: June 24, 2018
<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: corporate finance, investment management, private equity
<li>Review: This is the sixth course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/financial-management">Financial Management Specialization</a>, a four-module course. Recently I've been extremely busy with my job, almost got no time for this. That's why it took me so long to finish the course this time. I have a memo for this course on <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/37131534">Zhihu</a>, although I'm almost too reluctant to bother taking notes. It's just that you got so occupied, you don't have the spirit for MOOCs like the way you used to be.

<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: private equity, venture capital, finance
<li>Review: This is an introductory course on private equity and venture capital, without explicit need for background knowledge in finance, economics and accounting. It would be good to learn something like this before you embark on some serious education in finance and investment. <b>It's a good starting point, well worth the time.</b>

<li>Review: This is the fourth course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/financial-management">Financial Management Specialization</a>, a four-module course. This time the assignments are rather trivial, so it's basically a lecture-only course. <b>Still, I'm willing to rate it 5-star because the lectures are even better prepared than the previous one.</b> If only we had more excellent courses like this.

<li>Topic: finance, accounting, investment
<li>Review: This is the third course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/financial-management">Financial Management Specialization</a>, a four-module course. Brace yourself because this is a rather intensive one, with extremely long lectures and several peer-reviewed assignments. Don't rush to finish it by skipping the videos and go directly for the homework. I find watching the lectures very rewarding because <b>Professor Weisbenner is a rather funny guy and his lectures share a lot of insights and experiences</b>, which is far more valuable than what you'll get by simply finishing the course. Take the chance to communicate with brilliant minds whenever you have the chance. <b>Homeworks are trivial if you've really devoted yourself to the learnig process and tried to enjoy it, otherwise they'll just be chores and boring to the death.</b> I have a memo for this course on <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35523831">Zhihu</a>.

<li>Review: This is the first course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/financial-management">Financial Management Specialization</a>, I take this course to learn something about accounting, as a prior knowledge to financial engineering. The peer-reviewed assignment is good, though not enough people are willing to pay to join up, so you don't have as many classmates around the world to share insights with. Still, <b>peer review is a very idea-inspiring process</b>, it's quite different from working on computer programms and expect things to work exactly as you command. You actually seek difference from your own. <b>Investopedia is a good place to drop by.</b> You never get disappointed.

<li>Review: This is the fourth course of the deep learning specialization by Professor Andrew Ng. It's about one of hottest catchphrases, CNN. Convolutional neural network is indeed powerful, in that it's much more effecient and flexible than old-school MLP. Things also begin to get really misty from this point, as you see one magical model after another, without getting any sense where the hell is the explainability. <b>If there's anything that's actually illuminating, it's the feature visualization of CNN and neural style transfer that help you make sense of what every part of a huge CNN can possibly do and what the hidden layers mean.</b>

<li>Topic: deep learning, neural network, python
<li>Review: This is the first course of the deep learning specialization by Professor Andrew Ng. <b>It's explicitly made extremely easy because they wish to let AI and Deep learning be known to the general public, not just math/CS/stats professionals.</b> The course is a brief introduction on basic feedforward neural network. If you're a CS major, you're supposed to be able to finish this course within 3 days. Still, the interviews with several leading figures is the greatest part of this course. It is the "sense" from those academic masters that's the most valuable part, which we should try to perceive and follow. The programming assignments are organized as step-by-step tutorials, which take on average within 2 hours to finish.

<li>Review: This is the first course of the PGM series, which teaches you some basics of Bayesian inference, Markov network, factor graphs, etc. It's gonna be the building blocks of the bigger picture. If you're not quite familiar with algebra, calculus and probability theory, you're gonna have a hard time doing this. Also, this course is created in 2012, when Python han't risen to power, so you'll have to make do with Matlab. The programming assignments are about 50% reading comprehension, 40% researching and 10% coding. Make sure you take the time to do it by yourself. Cheating only takes ten minutes, and you'll gain nothing from it.

Actually, for small to middle-sized datasets, I think this kind of approach is quite handy, or shall we say, "lightweight". For extremely large datasets, small samples can be analyzed with toolkits like this to help make some sense, before we embark on deep learning and system-level optimizations.

<li>Topic: scala programming, parallel computing, data visualization, spark programming
<li>Review: Fifth course of the specialization, a step-by-step guide to a full scale project. The programming is challenging, while not at maths and algorithm, but at parallel programming, memorization, functional programming, all sorts of tweaking to make your code faster and tighter. The grader has a pretty tight memory limit of 1.5GB, which turned out to be a real headache, for you can experience failures randomly, making the programming assignment unnecessarily much harder. Still, every bit of effort pays off. Try it and see for yourself.

<li>Review: Fourth course of the specialization, relatively short and easy. The programming assignments took me a whole lot of time putting the APIs right. It's something you have to go through when learning a computation framework, no way around. Besides, the lecturer talks rather fast, with 1.5x play speed and no caption, I had the opportunity to practice my listening skill, that's the real fun.

<li>Topic: machine learning, Matlab
<li>Review: This is one of the "founding courses" of Coursera, thus it is supposed to be <b>easy and interesting</b> (otherwise people would've been scared off in the first place). So it is vital, for every programming assignment, that you try to <b>read and understand the 99% of codes already written for you</b>. The 1% for you to finish is really the trivial part. Otherwise there'll be no gain at all. Also it's fresh experience for those who get to <b>think in a vectorized manner</b> for the first time.

<li>Time: December 31, 2022
<li>Grade: 70/100
<li>Topic: propositional logic, formal language
<li>Review: This is a real challenging (mostly on <b>formal logic</b>) and inspiring course from Stanford. It's serious practice with lots of time-consuming and mind-boggling reading and exercises. The course has good tool for formal logic and proof quizzes, but I'd say it's still very challenging due to lack of support and further explanation (an apparent evidence of this MOOC <b>not well-made enough</b>). Some quizzes just need <b>further illustration on the correct answer</b> to ensure better understanding of what's really going on. Also there's basically <b>no video lecture, which proved a big downside for the course.</b> You'll find this course very introductory if you're math major (professionally), but for students like from CS background, you gotta be ready to burn some brain cells for it. Acutally <b>I got stuck on some of the proof quizzes</b> (some I couldn't, some I found buggy) and gave up at last. I just can't afford the <b>indefinite time needed</b> due to my current ongoing career plan. So, I'd <b>cautiously recommend</b> this course to you. Might be a headache, but still worth it for the sake of the <b>training in logical thinking</b>. And, <b>no, I didn't finish the course.</b>

<li>Review: First course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/costaccounting/">Cost Accounting Specialization</a>. It's the first MOOC course of TU München I've every tried. It's <b>very well-made</b>, in that the lectures are both <b>in details</b> and accompanied by <b>sufficient examples and illustrations</b>, to make sure you get ahold of concepts and calculation process. The talking speed is a bit slow, though. I had to play by 2.0x just to feel like normal.

<li>Grade: 100/100
<li>Topic: finance
<li>Review: The course has terrible review and rating, and I see why. The lectures and quizzes are actually <b>better than I expected</b> because the professor is highly skilled and knowledgeable. She knows her stuff too well and go through it too fast without well-formed definitions. Thus, it's a <b>bad course for beginners</b>, as it's totally not learner-friendly per se. I'd suggest you try <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/investment-management/"><b>the finance course from University of Geneva</b></a> instead. Still, the reading notes are very good. Week 5 is a proof that this course was made in a rush. It's supposed to be a full-fledged course called <b>"Introduction to Financial Engineering"</b>, as you see a ton of extra reading notes were provided that could've extended the course by another 3-5 weeks of lectures and quizzes. Guess Wharton was <b>just too lazy to make that happen</b>. I got some FE skills already, well, managed just fine.

The whole course is about making sense of <b>money and banking</b> world <b>without delving into calculus and algebra</b>. Nonetheless, some intermediate level of accounting and micro and macroeconomics training will help you better catch up with Professor Mehrling. The content is <b>really abundant and rewarding</b>, just do it. It's not about crunching numbers, though. If you're looking for some quantitative stuff, go to the financial engineering course instead.
